## Install Rust and the Rust toolchain

#####  1.Install `rustup` by running the following command: 

` curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh `

##### 2.Configure your current shell to reload your PATH environment variable so that it includes the Cargo `bin` directory by running the following command: 

` source ~/.cargo/env `

##### 3.Configure the Rust toolchain to default to the latest `stable` version by running the following commands: 

`rustup default stable`

`rustup update`

##### 4. Add the `nightly` release and the `nightly` WebAssembly (`wasm`) targets by running the following commands: 

`rustup update nightly`

`rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly`

##### 5. Verify your installation by running the following commands: 

`rustc --version`
`rustup show`

## Setup HexSpaceSocialGraph Protocol Node

### 1. Installing The Substrate Contracts Node

 We need to use a Substrate node with the built-in `pallet-contracts` pallet. For this workshop we'll use a pre-configured Substrate node client. 

`cargo install contracts-node --git https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node.git --tag v0.3.0 --force --locked`

### 2. Running a Substrate Smart Contracts Node

` substrate-contracts-node --dev  `


### Get source code

Please get the code from `https://github.com/rust-0x0/hex-space-protocol-front-end/tree/milestone-1`

```
git clone -b milestone-1 https://github.com/rust-0x0/hex-space-protocol-front-end.git
```

## Setup Contracts

HexSpaceSocialGraph Protocol Contracts builded version are provided in `builded_contracts`. 

It's developed with ink!.

### Get contracts

```
hex-space-protocol-front-end/builded_contracts/
```

## Deploy

The HexSpaceSocialGraph Protocol creates the substrate chain to connect the POLKADOT Ecology, and all contracts are deployed on the HexSpaceSocialGraph dev node. This section explains how to make use of Polkadot JS App to deploy contracts.

Use `https://polkadot.js.org/apps/` upload .contract file to deploy contract.

#### set the node IP and port ( `ws://127.0.0.1:9944` default).

#### Upload & Deploy contracts

Enter `Developer-> Contracts` and click Upload & deploy code.

![image](./images/deploy2.png)

Select the ERC1155 contract files that required to deploy contract.

![](./images/deploy3.png)

After you upload the contracts,  click 'copy' icon copy erc1155 hash value.
 you can instantiate the contract on the chain. In substrate, you need to perform the contract’s initialization function, usually new or the default function.
Select the initialization function call, fill in the initialization parameters, set the main contract administrator, and set the contract initial balance, click `Deploy`. Click `Deploy `, and `Submit and Sign`

## Initialization & Deploy HexSpace

# Setup HexSpaceSocialGraph Protocol Front-end

## Install `Polkadot JS Extension`

Please install `Polkadot JS Extension` before you start. You can get it from here https://polkadot.js.org/extension/

### Config front-end

Please  rename `example.env `  the file name to  '.env', and update the correct  contract address in   ```.env ```. 
#### 1. Click Hex Space contract icon,copy the contract address. 
![](./images/deploy5.png)
#### 2. Replace contract address of key 'REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS' in .env 

![](./images/deploy6.png)

#### 3. Replace connect path

And replace `.env REACT_APP_PROVIDER_SOCKET` to your connect path.

it should be `ws://127.0.0.1:9944` by default.

### Install dependencies

Run `yarn ` to install packages needed for this App.

### Start front-end

`yarn start` runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8100 to view it in the browser.

##### Get gas from extension account

In `https://polkadot.js.org/apps` Account page, use account  send gas to your extension account.

## Start front-end  docker

```bash
docker pull rust0x0/hex-space-protocol-front-end:0.1

# update the correct  contract address to env REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
docker run -e REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=5H4rkHhc6w1A95GDMDuFoTQ6MZcjxY4N5aHiUrSncXDrSasR -p 8100:8100  rust0x0/hex-space-protocol-front-end:0.1

```

## Start front-end  using docker-compose
update env REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS  to the correct  contract address  in docker-compose.yml file 
```bash
 environment:
      - REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=5H4rkHhc6w1A95GDMDuFoTQ6MZcjxY4N5aHiUrSncXDrSasR
```
```bash
 cd hex-space-protocol-front-end
docker-compose  up -d
## view logs
docker-compose logs -ft
```
